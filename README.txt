Lost Control v4.2.1

Sometimes party members are unaware of you being stunned/silenced or otherwise incapacitated and unable to heal/tank/dps effectively.

This addon checks your debuffs and notifies others where necessary (notified debuff types and message formats are customisable).

It has been tested, but there may still be odd bugs that I didn't see myself when playing, in which case let me know and I'll try to get it fixed.
